“The icing on the cake…” 
Our college excels in a whole slew of things. 
However, food tops the chart. The students can 
choose between an assortment of vegetarian and 
the non-vegetarian menu. This delectable food is 
prepared in separate chambers for veg and non-veg, 
in an entirely hygienic surroundings. Thanks to 
our Director, whose strong belief holds that eating
healthy helps in thinking healthy.
