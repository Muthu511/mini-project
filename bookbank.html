<center><h3>BOOK BANK</h3></center>

<p>
<pre>
•We have more than 12,000 titles of textbooks. 
In addition to the central library, students 
can procure a maximum of 7 books which they 
can retain till the end of the semester. 
•Only Rank Holders can obtain more books in 
addition to these 7 given by the book bank. 
•This book bank concept is because the Management 
ensures that the students of our College need not 
buy any books for their entire course of study. 
•Thus Parents are relieved of the expenditure 
incurred on the purchase of books for their wards
