<pre>
The college provides exceptional transport 
facility to the students and staff. 
Buses are available for all routes in the 
Chennai city and the suburbs. The buses are 
equipped with a speed governor and first aid 
facilities. To prevent accidents and late comers 
to the college, private vehicles and two wheelers 
are not permitted inside the college premises.
All services and repairs of the buses are done 
in the workshop inside the campus, along with 
which, the body building facilities are also 
available. In addition to that, the diesel 
bunk inside the campus supplies diesel for 
all the buses.The Buses are well and properly
